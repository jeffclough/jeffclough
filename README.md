## Prolog
Quoth King Soloman at the start of Ecclesiastes:

> **12** I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. **13** And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. **14** I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**15** What is crooked cannot be made straight,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what is lacking cannot be counted.<br/><br/>**16** I said in my heart, “I have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” **17** And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**18** For in much wisdom is much vexation,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.

**Early Development of a Developer:**
- I wasn't originally interested in software ... since I'd never heard of it.
- As a young child, I'd watched my grandfather build a [Heathkit](https://www.heathkit.com) television on the kitchen table. So I knew what a soldering iron was for, I'd seen lots of different kinds of components, and I knew that building things using all this was accessible to mortal man.
- Fast forward a few years, and I'd committed a significant portion of the Radio Shack catalog to memory. I was hooked on breadboarding digital logic (mostly [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits) stuff) for a while, but I was still pretty young and only had enough math to use [Ohm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law) to pull logic levels up or down and to avoid turning my LEDs into tiny little explosive devices. But I was buying components and supplies with a small allowance, and since I wasn't old enough to drive, I got my mom to drop me off at Radio Shack while she did her grocery shopping.
- Buying a handful of components was way quicker than buying the family groceries for the week, so I always had ample time to browse in Radio Shack. And one day, there sat their display model of [TRS-80 Model I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80). _AND_ there sat the user's manual right beside it. Fortunately for me, it started at step 0 and went on from there. After a few weeks of that, I was writing decreasingly crude [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) programs in the store while I waited. It pretty quickly became obvious that programming involved the same logic as the digital curcuits I'd been building ... with one _huge_ benefit: In the top, right-hand corner of the keyboard was a miraculous button with the word "BACKSPACE" written on it. Correcting mistakes with circuitry can be expensive, time-consuming, _expensive,_ and sometimes even dangerous. But the backspace key let me simply "fix it" as soon as I realized what I'd done wrong. I was officially hooked (and remain so) on software.
- I got to know the sales staff a bit. My mom, being a well-manored southern lady, would occasionally thank them for letting me hang out there and, "I hope he's not disturbing you." They, with dollar signs in their eyes, assured her that I was just fine. My folks bought me a TRS-80 that Christmas for what would be an astronomical amount of money for a Christmas present _today_, much less in the late 70s. :astonished:  It had no hard drive (whatever that was) or floppy drive (couldn't afford it) or even an operating system. But it _did_ have 4K of RAM (not a typo) and a BASIC interpreter in ROM. It was absolutely wonderful and created one of the _major_ inflection points in my life.
- If I was hooked before, I was even _hookter_ after that. I took a typing class because I was _clearly_ going to be using a keyboard for the rest of my life. I've been coding in progressively more advanced and powerful environments ever since. I might even have gotten a little better at it.

<a name="education"></a><br/>
**Education:**
- High school: Eastern Arkansas. Whatever that might bring to mind, it wasn't as fancy as the image in your head.
- College: Georgia State University. Their Business school was the only way to get any kind of computer degree at that time (from GSU, which I could afford), so I graduated with a BBA with a concentration in :sparkles: Computer Information Systems. :sparkles:
- Graduate school: Didn't go. I'd been working fulltime as a programmer for most of my undergraduate years (8 years, if we're counting), and graduation was too much like getting a permanent vacation for me to think about graduate school. (This was short-sighted of me, but that's how it was.)

<a name="work"></a><br/>
**Work:**
- My first profesisonal programming job was at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu). I was pulling down $17,500 my first year! (What on _earth_ was I going to do with all that money?! I had not the first clue.) It was great, and I learned a lot there, mostly coding for the computer center's fledgling networking group. I learned to spell "IP address" and had a [Bernouli Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_Box) (for all the storage I needed) attached to my [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) (4.77MHz, baby!).
- Time marched on and GSU's network team didn't really need a coder anymore. They eventually turned me into an [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com) operator because I could automate things using its [AutoLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoLISP) facility, since I'd had an [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) course, and [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) was how that worked back then. LISP was actually amazingly appropriate for wrangling CAD data. After a few months of that, I let my boss know I was looking for other work. He was a great guy, I knew he'd be cool with it, and I didn't want to pull the rug out from under him all of a sudden. A year later, I moved on to ...
- [System Engineering Services](https://www.sesc.com): I _sucked_ as a consultant. I don't interview well at all. Being disfunctionally candid, I answer questions like, "what do you see as your greatest weakness" honestly and without any qualms about being judged or rejected. Consultants can _not_ be that way. I did eventually get it gig with a company that managed data in the insurance industry. They needed a competent C++ programmer because they were just coming out of their start-up phase, and the people who wrote the original code could just barely spell Software Engineering.
- I was finally a good fit for someone as a consultant, so they hired me away from SES, and I started working with them full-time. That lasted about 6 years. The company was bought and sold more times than I could (or cared to) keep track of, and then came 2001. We were just past the chaos of [Y2K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem) [FUD](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/fud/), the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) was in mid-burst, and financial markets were in utter bewilderment following [9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks). The economy wasn't in great shape. It seemed like the whole IT industry just came crashing down. The company's new owners called it downsizing, but I was out of work for six months after that. Which worked out truly and unsarcastically _GREAT_ for me. I met my wife during this downtime.
- I'd enjoyed my time in "academia," so I started applying at colleges and universities. (Did you ever try looking for work when it seems like most of your whole industry is also looking for work? It's _rough_.) But I managed to hire on at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu) as a sysadmin. I _suck_ as a sysadmin, but I somehow got the job and started sucking marginally less. After a few months of suckage, I converted (somehow) to an application developer working for the same group. So I was back to programming and very happily so. I'm still working at Georgia Tech, mostly back-end stuff these days, mostly [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) and [PL/pgSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/pgSQL), and hope to retire from there in a few years. It's been a fantastic run, and it would be pathetically laughable if I complained about any of it.
- I do notice a trend as I look back over my programming career. I've had several titles, but I've also always maintained (mostly in email signatures) informal titles. Early in my career, with the brashness I've come to correlate with youth, my title was "Programmer Extraordinaire." I wasn't bragging. This title seemed to me, at the time, to be entirely accurate since so many others were coming to me with their coding puzzles. Some years later, after reading [Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra)'s [The Humble Programmer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html), half history and half optimism for the future,  I came to admire his perspective and adopted "Humble Programmer" as my unofficial title. Some of the uninformed got the wrong idea from this title, but such are the uninformed. I still have the desk-top nameplate with "Jeff Clough / Humble Programmer" on it, but today I use "Technical Minion" as my title of choice. I do so much customer support, albeit at a tier 3 level, that this title is more eloquently honest than my former characterizations. I've never been interested in chasing promotions, and I remain fairly competent in the technical world I work in, so ... Technical Minion. I can live with that very happily. (Plus, minions have a surprising operational latitude, and that can be fun.)

**How I Work:**

My body is almost entirely biological. It dietarily processes only carbohydrates, lipids, and amino and nucleic acids, but it also needs copious water and a modicum of cellulose to maintain chemical balances and for the mechanical breakdown of my food. Its olfactory system and area postrema, having good sensitivity and adequate discrimination, have always been sufficient to prevent or remedy the ingestion of anything intolerably unwholesome to it. Thanks for asking.

<a name="hobbies"></a><br/>
**Hobbies:**
- Hiking/Backpaking
  - My wife and I go backpacking with a group of friends every month or so during the warmer months. It's usually just an over-night, but we try to stretch that out if we get a holiday weekend.
  - We also enjoy this just as a couple. It's good to get away from everything _except_ each other from time to time. :couple: And it's good to be married to someone who feels the same way.
- Cycling
  - Mountain biking: In my younger days. I don't bounce very well anymore.
  - Road biking: Only occasionally now. I still enjoy it, but I don't have a group or a great place to ride. Sometimes my wife and I pick an ajacent town and do an out-and-back day trip. It's great exercise, and at my age, a zero-impact (when done properly) way to do that is a good thing.
- Small Programming Projects: I'd enumerate them, but ... you're already looking at [my stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffclough?tab=repositories).
- Electronics (yes, again): No more 7400 series digital logic, building flip flops from discrete gates, or any of that stuff. Now we have microcontrollers, which are actually a lot like that TRS-80 I cut my teeth on. There's no operating system, so the whole computer is focused entirely on what I tell it (for better or worse). And debugging is very primitive. It's great. With the advent of IoT, I can merge electronics back into my programming. [Two great tastes that taste great together!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJLDF6qZUX0)
- Photography: This is _mostly_ a hobby, but I do occasionally get paid for stuff. It's a lot of fun. Mostly travel, landscape, and wildlife, but I also really enjoy portrait and event work. You can see [some of my portrait and livestyle stuff](https://www.jeffclough.photo) if you'd like, but I don't really keep it up to date very well. \<sigh\> ... the cobbler's children ...

## Epilog
Quoth King Soloman at the end of Ecclesiastes:

> **13** The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. **14** For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.
