**Early Development of a Developer:** I wasn't originally interested in software ... since I'd never heard of it.
- As a young child, I'd watched my grandfather build a [Heathkit](https://www.heathkit.com) television on the kitchen table. So I knew what a soldering iron was for, I'd seen lots of different kinds of components, and I knew that building things using all this was accessible to mortal man.
- Fast forward a few years, and I'd committed a significant portion of the Radio Shack catalog to memory. I was hooked on breadboarding digital logic (mostly [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits) stuff) for a while, but I was still pretty young and only had enough math to use [Ohm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law) to pull logic levels up or down and to avoid turning my LEDs into tiny little explosive devices. But I was buying components and supplies with a small allowance, and since I wasn't old enough to drive, I got my mom to drop me off at Radio Shack while she did her grocery shopping.
- Buying a handful of components was way quicker than buying the family groceries for the week, so I always had ample time to browse in Radio Shack. And one day, there sat their display model of [TRS-80 Model I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80). _AND_ there sat the user's manual right there beside it. Fortunately for me, it started at step 0 and went on from there. After a few weeks of that, I was writing decreasingly crude BASIC programs in the store while I waited. It pretty quickly became obvious that programming involved the same logic as the digital curcuits I'd been building ... with one _huge_ benefit: In the top, right-hand corner of the keyboard was a miraculous button with the work "BACKSPACE" written on it. Correcting mistakes with circuitry can be expensive, time-consuming, expensive, and sometimes even dangerous. But the backspace key let me simply "fix it" as soon as I realized what I'd done wrong. I was officially hooked (and remain so) on software.
- I got to know the sales staff a bit. My mom, being a well-manored southern lady, would occasionally thank them for letting me hang out there and, "I hope he's not disturbing you." They, with dollar signs in their eyes, assured her that I was just fine. My folks bought me a TRS-80 that Christmas for what would be an astronomical amount of money for a Christmas present _today_, much less in the late 70s. :astonished:  It had no hard drive (whatever that was) or floppy drive (couldn't afford it) or even an operating system. But it _did_ have 4K of RAM (not a typo) and a BASIC interpreter in ROM. It was absolutely wonderful and created one of the _major_ inflection point in my life.
- If I was hooked before, I was even _hookter_ after that. I took a typing class because I was _clearly_ going to be using a keyboard for the rest of my life. I've been coding in progressively more advanced and powerful environments ever since. I might even have gotten a little better at it.

**Education:**
- High school: Eastern Arkansas. Whatever that might bring to mind, it wasn't as fancy as you're thinking it was.
- College: Georgia State University. Their Business school was the only way to get any kind of computer degree at that time, so I graduated with a BBA with a concentration in :sparkles: Computer Information Systems. :sparkles:
- Graduate school: Did't go. I'd been working as a programmer for most of my undergraduate years (8 years, if we're counting), and graduation was too much like getting a permanent vacation for me to think about graduate school. (This was short-sighted of me, but that's how it was.)

<a name="work"></a><br/>
**Work:**
- My first profesisonal programming job was at [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu). I was pulling down $17,500 my first year! (What on _earth_ was I going to do with all that money?! I had not the first clue.) It was great, and I learned a lot there, mostly coding for the computer center's fledgling networking group. I learned to spell "IP address" and had a [Bernouli Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_Box) attached to my [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) (4.77MHz, baby!) for all the disk space I needed.
- Time marched on and GSU's network team didn't really need a coder anymore. They eventually turned me into an [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com) operator because I could automate things using its [AutoLISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoLISP) facility, since I'd had an AI course, and LISP was how that worked back then. LISP was actually amazingly appropriate for wrangling CAD data. After a few months of that, I let me boss know I was looking for other work. He was a great guy, I knew he'd be cool with it, and I didn't want to pull the rug out from under him. A year later, I moved on to ...
- [System Engineering Services](https://www.sesc.com): I _sucked_ as a consultant. I don't interview well at all. Being disfunctionally candid, I answer questions like, "what do you see as your greatest weakness" honestly and without any qualms about being rejected. Consultants can _not_ be that way. I did eventually get it gig with a company that managed data for the insurance industry. They needed a competent C++ programmer because they were just coming out of their start-up phase, and the people who wrote the original code could just barely spell Software Engineering.
- I was finally a good fit for someone as a consultant, so they hired me away from SES, and I started working with them full-time. That lasted about 6 years. The company got bought and sold more times that I could (or cared to) keep track of, and then came 2001. Between the lingering effects of Y2K and the sheer market bewilderment following 9/11, the economy wasn't in great shape. It seemed like the whole IT industry just came crashing down. The called it downsizing, but I was out of work for six months after that. Which worked out truly and unsarcastically _GREAT!_ I met my wife during this downtime. 
- I'd enjoyed my time in "academia," so I started applying at colleges and universities. (Did you ever try looking for work when it seems like most of your whole industry is also looking for work? It's _rough_.) But I managed to hire on at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu) as a sysadmin. I _suck_ as a sysadmin, but I somehow got the job and started sucking marginally less. After a few months of suckage, I converted (somehow) to an application developer working for the same group. So I was back to programming and very happily so. I'm still working at Georgia Tech, mostly back-end stuff these days, and hope to retire from there in a few years. It's been a fantastic run, and it would be pathetically laughable if I complained about any of it.

**How I Work:** My body is almost entirely biological. It dietarily processes only carbohydrates, lipids, and amino and nucleic acids, but it also needs copious water and a modicum of cellulose for maintaining chemical balances and mechanical breakdown of the food I eat. The sensitivity and discrimination of its olfactory system and area postrema have always been sufficient to prevent or remedy the ingestion of anything intolerably unwholesome to it. Thanks for asking.

**Hobbies:**
- Hiking/Backpaking
  - My wife and I go backpacking with a group of friends every month or so during the warmer months. It's just just an over-night, but we try to stretch it out if we get a holiday weekend.
  - We also enjoy this just as a couple. It's good to get away from everything _except_ each other. :couple: And it's good to be married to someone who feels the same way.
- Cycling
  - Mountain biking: In my younger days. I don't bounce very well anymore.
  - Road biking: Only occasionally now. I still enjoy it, but I don't have a group or a great place to ride. Sometimes my wife and I pick an ajacent town and do a day trip. It's great exercise, and at my age, a zero-impact (when done properly) way to do that is a good thing.
- Small Programming Projects: I'd enumerate them, but ... you're already looking at [my stuff on GitHub](https://github.com/jeffclough?tab=repositories).
- Electronics (yes, again): No more 7400 series digital logic, building flip flops from discrete gates, or any of that stuff. Now we have microcontrollers, which are actually a lot like that TRS-80 I cut my teeth on. There's no operating system, so the whole computer is focused entirely on what I tell it (for better or worse). And debugging is very primitive. It's great. With the advent of IoT, I can merge electronics back into my programming. [Two great tastes that taste great together!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJLDF6qZUX0)
- Photography: This is _mostly_ a hobby, but I do occasionally get paid for stuff. It's a lot of fun. Mostly travel, landscape, and wildlife, but I also really enjoy portrait and event work. You can see [some of my portrait and livestyle stuff](https://www.jeffclough.photo) if you'd like, but I don't really keep it up to date very well. \<sigh\> ... the cobbler's children ...
